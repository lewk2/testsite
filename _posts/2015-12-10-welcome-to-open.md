This is the first ever post created in the fledgling Cinegy Open portal.

Incidentally, this portal is built using [Jekyll][jekyll], a really neat way to build fast websites.

<div class="note info">
  <h5>Built with Jekyll</h5>
  <p>
    The site was build using docker, and this post was written with `nano` and then the site built and launched with `jekyll server`.
  </p>
</div>

I'm really interested in showing a code snippet, so here is hopefully some C#:

{% highlight c# %}
Console.WriteLine("Hello, Open");
{% endhighlight %}
